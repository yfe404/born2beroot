Ok I have my base image with disk partitionning as expected (bonus section)

Next step: setting up the ssh service running on port 4242 
note: root login must not be allowed. 

That's trivial, we just need to install `openssh-server`, edit the file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, 
specifically these two lines:

```
...
Port 4242
...
PermitRootLogin no
...
```

And enable the service: 
`systemctl enable --now sshd`

Easy. 

EDIT: of course we need to edit /etc/apt/sources.list first as the urls points to the cdrom (that we don't have). And run a `apt update`.

We can test that using a port forwarding in VBox (if NAT) or directlty ssh-ing the VM ip (if bridged)

Next, set up of UFW, letting only traffic to and from 4242 (ssh)

However, simply installing the firewall will not turn it on automatically, nor it will have any rule set by default.  

So we need to add our rules and enable / start the service. 

```
# ufw enable 
```

Since we use a custom port for ssh, we cannot just `ufw allow ssh`, we need to `ufw allow 4242/tcp`

Next step changing the hostname

Since we use systemd this is very easy: `hostnamectl set-hostname HOSTNAME`
