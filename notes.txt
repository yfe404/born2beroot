Ok I have my base image with disk partitionning as expected (bonus section)

Next step: setting up the ssh service running on port 4242 
note: root login must not be allowed. 

That's trivial, we just need to install `openssh-server`, edit the file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, 
specifically these two lines:

```
...
Port 4242
...
PermitRootLogin no
...
```

And enable the service: 
`systemctl enable --now sshd`

Easy. 

EDIT: of course we need to edit /etc/apt/sources.list first as the urls points to the cdrom (that we don't have). And run a `apt update`.

We can test that using a port forwarding in VBox (if NAT) or directlty ssh-ing the VM ip (if bridged)

-----

Next, set up of UFW, letting only traffic to and from 4242 (ssh)

However, simply installing the firewall will not turn it on automatically, nor it will have any rule set by default.  

So we need to add our rules and enable / start the service. 

```
# ufw enable 
```

Since we use a custom port for ssh, we cannot just `ufw allow ssh`, we need to `ufw allow 4242/tcp`

------


Next step changing the hostname

Since we use systemd this is very easy: `hostnamectl set-hostname HOSTNAME`


-------

Now let setup the password policy

https://www.server-world.info/en/note?os=Debian_10&p=password

We need to install the password quality checking library
`apt install libpam-pwquality`

and then edit these 2 files:
- /etc/login.defs 
- /etc/security/pwquality.conf 

according to the subject.


------


Next installation and configuration of sudo

`apt install sudo`


we can also create and add our use to sudo
`adduser foo -G sudo`

or add an existing user to sudo 
`adduser foo sudo`




Source: `man sudoers`




#### MONIT SCRIPT

For the disk usage, there a several approach and ways to compute it. For instance should the boot partition be included or not ? RAM based fs? I will choose to report only the mounted partions that uses LVM on /de/sda5 since everything is here. I will also report per partition as it makes more sense to me. 

cpu usage: https://askubuntu.com/questions/274349/getting-cpu-usage-realtime


checking if lvm is used:
pvdisplay is enough to check if you're using LVM, because it lists all physical volumes that belong to LVM.

Why it's enough:

    pvdisplay shows LVM physical volumes (PVs), which are the lowest level of LVM (typically /dev/sdX or /dev/mapper/... devices initialized for LVM).

    If you see output from pvdisplay, you are using LVM â€” at least one disk or partition has been initialized as a physical volume.

	[Physical Volume] -> [Volume Group] -> [Logical Volumes] -> [Mounted Filesystems]

with -q check silently 

	if sudo pvdisplay 2>/dev/null | grep -q UUID; then
    in_use=yes
