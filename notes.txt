Ok I have my base image with disk partitionning as expected (bonus section)

Next step: setting up the ssh service running on port 4242 
note: root login must not be allowed. 

That's trivial, we just need to install `openssh-server`, edit the file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, 
specifically these two lines:

```
...
...

...

```

And enable the service: 
`systemctl enable --now sshd`

Easy.
